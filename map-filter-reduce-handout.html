//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
//
// var numbersAddOne = [];
//
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i+= 1) {
//     numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
// }
// console.log(numbersAddOne); // [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]


//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num) {
    return num + 1;
});

//console.log(numbersAddOneMap);

//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

var restaurantArray = [{name: "Olive Garden", address: "13730 San Pedro Ave, San Antonio, TX 78232"}, {name: "Hopdoddy's", address: "1301 N Loop 1604 W #101, San Antonio, TX 78258"}, {name: "Whataburger", address: "11003 NW Military Hwy, San Antonio, TX 78231"}];

let nameList = restaurantArray.map(function(restaurant) {
    return restaurant.name;
});

//console.log(nameList);

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

var favoriteRestaurants = [
    {
        name: "Magnolia Pancake Haus",
        address: "606 Embassy Oaks #100, San Antonio, TX 78216",
        restaurantFeatures: ["Dine-in", "To-go"]
    },
    {
        name: "Pluckers",
        address: "15651 McDermott Freeway, I-10, San Antonio, TX 78249",
        restaurantFeatures: ["Dine-in", "To-go"]
    },
    {
        name: "Wingstop",
        address: "502 Embassy Oaks Ste 126, San Antonio, TX 78216",
        restaurantFeatures: ["Dine-in", "To-go"]
    },
    {
        name: "Brasao Brazilian Steakhouse",
        address: "19210 I-10, San Antonio, TX 78257",
        restaurantFeatures: ["Dine-in"]
    },
    {
        name: "Golden Corral",
        address: "5071 Northwest Loop 410, San Antonio, TX 78229",
        restaurantFeatures: ["Dine-in", "To-go", "Buffet"]
    }];

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

var favList = favoriteRestaurants.map(function (restaurant) {
    return `One of my favorite restaurants is ${restaurant.name}, and it's located at ${restaurant.address}!`
});

//console.log(favList);

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

//let evens = [];

// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         evens.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

let evens = numbers.filter(function(num) {
    return num % 2 === 0;
});

//console.log(evens);

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants
// Works correctly
let hasBuffet = favoriteRestaurants.filter(function (restaurant) {
    return restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes("Buffet");
});
// Works the same way as above^^, but now using an arrow function!
let hasBuffetES6 = favoriteRestaurants.filter(restaurant => restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes("Buffet"));

//console.log(hasBuffet);

//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

let restaurantFiltered = favoriteRestaurants.filter(restaurant => restaurant.name.length > 10);

console.log(restaurantFiltered); // returns 3 restaurants that have a name longer than 10 characters long

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!

let restaurantFiltered2 = favoriteRestaurants.filter(restaurant => restaurant.name[3] === "s");

console.log(restaurantFiltered2); // returns the Brasao Brazilian Steak House object since it has the character "s" in its "name" property at the index of [3]

//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

//In the past we would have built out a loop, probably used a var of sum, and had a look inside of the loop of sum += numbers[i], and spit out the sum with the sum of our numbers

//In ES6 with .reduce(). .reduce() has a couple of componenets to it: .reduce(callbackFunction, initialValue)

let sum = numbers.reduce((accumulation, currentNum) => {
    return accumulation + currentNum
}, 0);

console.log(sum);

//TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco Cohort", "ES6"] would get us {}



//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.


//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!



//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).
